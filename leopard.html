                <p class="sec_leo_detail">
                    Yala National Park is renowned for having one of the highest leopard densities in the world. 
                    The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), a subspecies native to the island, is the apex predator in this ecosystem. 
                    Leopards in Yala are known for their adaptability to various habitats, including dense jungles and open grasslands.
                    <br><br>
                    These elusive cats often roam the park in search of prey, including spotted deer, wild boar, and water buffalo. 
                    Known for their exceptional climbing abilities, leopards in Yala may be spotted lounging on tree branches, providing a unique spectacle for fortunate safari-goers.

                <h3 class="sec_head">Best Time for Leopard Sightings</h3>
                <p class="sec_leo_detail">
                    The dry season, from February to July, is considered the best time for leopard sightings in Yala. 
                    During this period, water becomes scarce, leading to increased wildlife congregating around the remaining water sources, making it easier to spot leopards. Additionally, the vegetation thins out, improving visibility and enhancing the chances of encountering these elusive big cats.

                <p class="sec_leo_detail">
                    Leopards, although not as prominently featured as in some other parks, inhabit the unique ecosystems of Horton Plains National Park. 
                    The high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests provide a distinct setting for these elusive big cats. 
                    Adapted to the cooler climate, Horton Plains leopards exhibit behaviors shaped by the challenges of their elevated environment.
                    <br><br>
                    The leopards in Horton Plains are known for their solitary nature, utilizing the terrain to their advantage for both hunting and elusive movements. 
                    While sightings may be less frequent than in lowland areas, the thrill of encountering a leopard in this high-altitude sanctuary is a unique and rewarding experience.
                </p>

                <p class="sec_leo_detail">
                    Leopard sightings in Horton Plains are not confined to specific seasons due to the relatively consistent climate of the highlands. 
                    However, the dry season, which spans from December to March, is often considered favorable for wildlife observation. 
                    During this period, the vegetation is less dense, enhancing visibility and potentially increasing the chances of spotting leopards.

                <p class="sec_leo_detail">
                    Wilpattu is home to a healthy population of Sri Lankan leopards, making it one of the key parks for leopard conservation. 
                    These leopards exhibit a range of behaviors, from stealthy movements in the thick vegetation to open-area pursuits when hunting prey. 
                    The park's diverse ecosystems offer leopards ample cover for stalking and ambushing their prey, contributing to their reputation as skilled and adaptable predators.
                    <br><br>
                    Visitors to Wilpattu have the opportunity to witness leopards in their natural habitat, showcasing the interconnectedness of the park's ecosystems and the conservation efforts in place to protect these magnificent cats.

                <p class="sec_leo_detail">
                    The dry season, from June to October, is considered the optimal time for leopard sightings in Wilpattu. 
                    During this period, water sources become scarce, leading to increased wildlife activity around remaining water bodies. 
                    The reduced vegetation also enhances visibility, improving the chances of spotting leopards as they roam in search of prey.
