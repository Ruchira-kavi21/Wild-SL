          <p class="sec_leo_detail">
            Yala National Park is renowned for having one of the highest leopard
            densities in the world. The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus
            kotiya), a subspecies native to the island, is the apex predator in
            this ecosystem. Leopards in Yala are known for their adaptability to
            various habitats, including dense jungles and open grasslands.
            <br /><br />
            These elusive cats often roam the park in search of prey, including
            spotted deer, wild boar, and water buffalo. Known for their
            exceptional climbing abilities, leopards in Yala may be spotted
            lounging on tree branches, providing a unique spectacle for
            fortunate safari-goers.

          <h3 class="sec_head">Best Time for Leopard Sightings</h3>
          <p class="sec_leo_detail">
            The dry season, from February to July, is considered the best time
            for leopard sightings in Yala. During this period, water becomes
            scarce, leading to increased wildlife congregating around the
            remaining water sources, making it easier to spot leopards.
            Additionally, the vegetation thins out, improving visibility and
            enhancing the chances of encountering these elusive big cats.

          <p class="sec_leo_detail">
            Leopards, although not as prominently featured as in some other
            parks, inhabit the unique ecosystems of Horton Plains National Park.
            The high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests provide a distinct
            setting for these elusive big cats. Adapted to the cooler climate,
            Horton Plains leopards exhibit behaviors shaped by the challenges of
            their elevated environment.
            <br /><br />
            The leopards in Horton Plains are known for their solitary nature,
            utilizing the terrain to their advantage for both hunting and
            elusive movements. While sightings may be less frequent than in
            lowland areas, the thrill of encountering a leopard in this
            high-altitude sanctuary is a unique and rewarding experience.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sec_head">Best Time for Leopard Sightings</h3>
          <p class="sec_leo_detail">
            Leopard sightings in Horton Plains are not confined to specific
            seasons due to the relatively consistent climate of the highlands.
            However, the dry season, which spans from December to March, is
            often considered favorable for wildlife observation. During this
            period, the vegetation is less dense, enhancing visibility and
            potentially increasing the chances of spotting leopards.

            Wilpattu is home to a healthy population of Sri Lankan leopards,
            making it one of the key parks for leopard conservation. These
            leopards exhibit a range of behaviors, from stealthy movements in
            the thick vegetation to open-area pursuits when hunting prey. The
            park's diverse ecosystems offer leopards ample cover for stalking
            and ambushing their prey, contributing to their reputation as
            skilled and adaptable predators.
            <br /><br />
            Visitors to Wilpattu have the opportunity to witness leopards in
            their natural habitat, showcasing the interconnectedness of the
            park's ecosystems and the conservation efforts in place to protect
            these magnificent cats.

            The dry season, from June to October, is considered the optimal time

            become scarce, leading to increased wildlife activity around
            remaining water bodies. The reduced vegetation also enhances
            visibility, improving the chances of spotting leopards as they roam
            in search of prey.

        <h3 class="title">Habitat Loss and Fragmentation</h3>
        <p class="detail">
          <img class="Img1" src="images/habitat.jpg" />
          Habitat loss and fragmentation pose severe and escalating threats to
          leopard populations across the globe. As human populations continue to
          expand, natural landscapes are being rapidly transformed for
          agricultural, urban, and industrial purposes. This anthropogenic
          impact results in the destruction of large swaths of leopard habitats
          and the fragmentation of once contiguous areas. The consequences are
          far-reaching, impacting the leopards' ability to find adequate
          territories, prey, and suitable breeding grounds.
        </p>
        <p class="detail">
          The ramifications of habitat loss and fragmentation are multifaceted
          and alarming. Firstly, as leopards' natural habitats shrink, they are
          forced into closer proximity to human settlements, leading to an
          upsurge in human-wildlife conflicts. Leopards, in search of food and
          territory, may venture into villages, resulting in attacks on
          livestock or, in extreme cases, on humans. This escalation often
          prompts retaliatory killings, further endangering leopard populations.
          <br /><br />
          Secondly, the fragmentation of habitats disrupts essential ecological
          processes. It interferes with natural migration routes, hinders the
          establishment of territories, and impedes breeding patterns. These
          disruptions can lead to a decline in genetic diversity among leopard
          populations, reducing their adaptive capacity to environmental
          changes. This diminished genetic diversity makes them more vulnerable
          to diseases and other threats, undermining the overall health and
          resilience of the species.

        <h3 class="title">Illegal Wildlife Trade and Poaching</h3>
        <p class="detail">
          <img class="Img2" src="images/illegal.jpg" />
          Illegal wildlife trade and poaching represent a grave menace to
          leopard populations worldwide. Leopards are targeted for their coveted
          skins, bones, and other body parts, driven by the demand in
          traditional medicine, luxury markets, and the exotic pet trade. This
          illegal commerce exerts immense pressure on leopard populations,
          pushing them towards the brink of endangerment.
        </p>
        <p class="detail">
          The consequences of illegal wildlife trade and poaching are dire and
          extend beyond the immediate loss of individual leopards. Firstly, the
          direct impact results in a decline in leopard numbers as they are
          ruthlessly hunted for their valuable parts. Beyond this, the removal
          of leopards from their natural ecosystems disrupts the delicate
          balance within these habitats. With leopards serving as apex
          predators, their absence can lead to an overpopulation of certain prey
          species, negatively affecting vegetation and other wildlife in the
          area.
          <br /><br />
          Moreover, the involvement of organized crime in illegal wildlife trade
          further complicates conservation efforts. Poaching networks often
          operate across borders, making it challenging to combat this illicit
          activity effectively. The high profitability of leopard parts in black
          markets perpetuates the demand, driving a vicious cycle that threatens
          the survival of leopard populations across their range. Efforts to
          combat this multifaceted threat require coordinated international
          action, stringent law enforcement, and community engagement to address
          the root causes of illegal wildlife trade and poaching.
